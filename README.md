# Machine-Learning-Project- Supermarket Sales Prediction

This project is part of my learning Machine Learning.
The Dataset is given with total of 13 features. To improove the model's performance, I have removed 3 useless features from the dataset which is not contributing to the prediction. Model's performance is increased by 4.32%. I have collected, cleaned, and analyzed supermarket sales data to uncover patterns in customer behavior and product performance. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends in sales by product line, 
customer type, Supermarket Opening Year, Supermarket Size, and with other features.
